Reflection on the Class;
- > I enjoyed this class much more than I thought I would. I had a completely different idea on what the class was about
and ended up having quite a surprise. I refreshed and improved my programming and coding abilities regarding several
topics about Decision Support Analysis, it was pretty interesting to get know different techniques to reach out for
effective and informed decisions on multiple areas, like deciding where to invest efforts, resources, money; on 
orienting the enterprises focus on costs, profits, among many others. I appreciated the guidance given by the professor
while solving different minicases and how to interpret the results obtained.
